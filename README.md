My submission for a technical interview with 'Imagine Everything', under this prompt: "...create an application that processes or interacts with the data in an interesting or meaningful way. You are welcome to use any language you desire and you can spend as much or as little time as you want..."

Note! This is missing the neo4j database, which is too large to upload to github (100mb limit). All files with database here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_1CTFa6LzA4pScQZYe78KQu09JzT3obw?usp=sharing.
